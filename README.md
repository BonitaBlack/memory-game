## NOTES
For Udacity Students
If you are one of Udacity students:

Feel free to copy this project and use it, BUT remember that the main GOAL is to learn how you can do projects by yourself.
This is not the only or even best one, there are many ways to achieve the same results.  I would direct you to codepen where there are some truly impressive memory games.

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.

THANK YOU ...
